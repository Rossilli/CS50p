#### Description: The rock_paper_scissors.py file contains the implementation of a Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The file contains several functions, main() function the main function serves as the entry point for the game. It starts by calling the pick function, which prompts the user to choose either Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The function then calls the random_cpu function, which generates a random choice for the computer. Finally, the play function is called, passing in the user's and computer's choices, and determining the winner of the game. The result is printed to the screen. The pick function is responsible for asking the user to make a choice between Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The function uses the input function to get the user's choice and converts it to lowercase using the lower method. The function uses a while loop to validate the user's input and ensures that only valid choices (i.e. Rock, Paper, or Scissors) are accepted. If the user inputs an invalid choice, they are prompted again to make a valid choice. Once a valid choice is made, the function returns the user's choice. The random_cpu function is responsible for generating a random choice for the computer. It uses the random.choice function from the random module to select a random item from the rps list (which contains the choices Rock, Paper, and Scissors). The computer's choice is then printed to the screen using the print function. The function returns the computer's choice. The play function determines the winner of the game based on the user's and computer's choices. The function uses an if-elif-else statement to compare the choices and determine the winner. If the user's and computer's choices are the same, the result is a tie. If the user's choice beats the computer's choice (e.g. Rock beats Scissors), the user wins. If the computer's choice beats the user's choice (e.g. Scissors beats Paper), the computer wins. The function returns the result of the game as a string (e.g. "You win", "Tie!", "You lose") and the rock_paper_scissors.py file also contains an if __name__ == "__main__": statement that calls the main function when the file is run as the main module. This allows the game to be run as a standalone application, while still allowing the functions to be imported and used in other applications if needed.
